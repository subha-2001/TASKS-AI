# TEXT-SUMMARIZATION

Here's a README file for text summarization :

**Text Summarization with Transformers**

This code utilizes the `transformers` library to create a simple text summarization pipeline. It demonstrates how to:

1. Import the necessary library.
2. Create a summarization pipeline using the `transformers.pipeline` function.
3. Define the text you want to summarize.
4. Call the pipeline on the input text, specifying a desired maximum summary length (`max_length`) and disabling sampling (`do_sample=False` for deterministic output).
5. Print the generated summary.

**Requirements:**

* transformers library (`pip install transformers`)
* flask (pip install flask)
* torch (pip install torch) (if you want specific version 2.0 like that)

**Usage:**

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Install the required library using `pip install transformers`.
3. Run the script (`python summarize.py`).

**Example Output:**

The output will be a shortened version of the input text, capturing the key points within the specified maximum length. 

**Note:**

* This is a basic implementation and can be further customized for specific needs. 
* You can explore different pre-trained summarization models available in the `transformers` library.

**Additional Considerations:**

* Error handling: Consider adding error handling for potential issues like missing libraries or incorrect input formats.
* Advanced Usage:  For more advanced use cases, you can explore fine-tuning pre-trained models on specific summarization tasks or domains.
